# 🚁 Parrot-Minidrone-Send-Email-Red-Image-

A Simulink-controlled autonomous drone project using a Parrot Mambo Minidrone that detects red objects on the ground, calculates the geometric center, hovers over it, and triggers an image snapshot to be sent via email. 
📌 This project was completed as part of a **vacation work program at [Opti-Num Solutions](https://www.optinum.co.za/)**.


## 🔑 Features

- ✅ Real-time red object detection 
- 📍 Geometric center calculation and precision hovering
- 🗺️ Lawnmower path planning area exploration
- 📷 Automatic image capture triggered by detection
- ✉️ Image saved and emailed using Interpreted MATLAB Function
-

## 🛠️ Built With:

- **Simulink** – for modeling and control logic
- **MATLAB** – for vision processing, TCP server, and email automation
- **Parrot Mambo Minidrone** – hardware platform with downward camera
- **Image Thresholding App** – to tune red detection limits
